#Simple E-commerce website using Next.js

I am learning Nextjs and React things. I want to build super simple ecommerce website.

Technologies use:
 * Nextjs
 * React
 * Prisma 2.0
 * Styled Component
 * Jest and testing-libary
 * Boostrap style
 * Passport js
 
To run this project, you need a database and connect with Prisma config, reach me via email khoaln6@gmail.com to get db file and structure.
